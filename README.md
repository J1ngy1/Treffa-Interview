# Task 1: MongoDB and UUIDv4 Analysis

## Problem Overview
- Install MongoDB, and create a database called ‚Äòtest‚Äô and a collection called ‚Äòuuid‚Äô.
- Write a TypeScript function to add 100,000 UUIDv4s to the collection as Document primary keys.
- Write a TypeScript function to calculate the count of each of the characters in each UUID, then count the number of the 100,000 UUIDs that share the same per-character counts. Output the average number of UUIDs of the 100,000 that share the same per-character counts.

## Design Approach
1. Set up MongoDB and connect to the database `test`.
2. Write a function to generate 100,000 UUIDv4s and insert them into the `uuid` collection. The UUIDs were stored as the `_id` of each document.
3. Write another function to process the UUIDs and compute character frequency for each one. I used MongoDB‚Äôs aggregation pipeline.
4. Calculate the number of UUIDs with the same frequency pattern and compute the average.

## Implementation
- I used a batch approach to insert the UUIDs in chunks of 1,000 for better performance.
- The character frequency calculation used MongoDB‚Äôs `$function` to execute JavaScript directly within the database.

## Problems and Solutions
- Initially, MongoDB threw errors about `_id` types. I resolved this by defining `_id` as `string` in the TypeScript schema.

## Results
The script successfully inserted and processed 100,000 UUIDv4s. The results showed:
- **Total UUIDs Processed**: 100,000
- **Unique Character Count Patterns**: 100,000
- **Average UUIDs Sharing the Same Pattern**: 1.00

These results make sense because UUIDv4s are highly random, and it‚Äôs rare for two UUIDs to share the same character frequency pattern. 

Here‚Äôs an example output:
```
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB
üåü Step 1: Inserting 100,000 UUIDv4s...
‚úÖ UUIDs successfully inserted!
üåü Step 2: Calculating character counts...
‚úÖ Character counts successfully calculated!
üåü Step 3: Calculating averages...

======================== RESULTS ========================
Total UUIDs Processed: 100000
Unique Character Count Patterns: 100000
Average UUIDs Sharing Same Pattern: 1.00
